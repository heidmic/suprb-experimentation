# SupRB-2 experimentation

This repo contains a collection of preset experiments going beyond the examples in the main SupRB-2 repository (https://github.com/heidmic/suprb) 
The main repository contains the source code of the supervised machine learning system.
This repo also features scripts to automatically perform hyperparametersearch, run on SLURM-based server infrastructure and to generate tables and graphs based on run results.
